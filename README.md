#### Welcome to the WashU Test Project

Exercise for Group: 

This will incorporate a lot of the skills we have learned and will also require us to work as a team

Steps: 


1. Find a Teammate to work with 

2. Fork the WashU Test Project 

3. In your fork, Add a line to the Readme that says "Includes <insertnamehere>'s text file"

4. Add the WashU Test Project as an Upstream to keep work in sync (hint: when you clone the project down to your workspace from Github...what happens?)

5. Once you have made the edits from Step 3 above, make a pull request to WashU_Test Project that asks for your work to be added

6. Keep your work on your local machine and on your fork in sync with the WashU Test Project
